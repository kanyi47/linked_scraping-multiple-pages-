# LinkedIn_scraping - multiple-pages
A selenium LinkedIn scraper that loops through multiple pages to collect profile data
It is relatively slow because it mimicks a real human operation, clicking every link to get the data, but that's why it works without the stubborn LinkedIn blocking it.
It was a trial project that I spent a lot of time on and had to make sure it works. You can change the xpaths to fit the data points you want. Mine are pretty crazy and definitely not 100% accurate
